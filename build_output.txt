./src/components/widgets/MapComponent.tsx
44:22  Warning: The ref value 'mapContainer.current' will likely have changed by the time this effect cleanup function runs. If this ref points to a node rendered by React, copy 'mapContainer.current' to a variable inside the effect, and use that variable in the cleanup function.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./src/components/widgets/chord-chart/CustomChordDiagram.tsx
22:9  Warning: The 'arcColors' array makes the dependencies of useEffect Hook (at line 131) change on every render. Move it inside the useEffect callback. Alternatively, wrap the initialization of 'arcColors' in its own useMemo() Hook.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./src/components/widgets/sankey-chart/CustomSankeyDiagram.tsx
58:9  Warning: The 'sankeyNodes' array makes the dependencies of useEffect Hook (at line 292) change on every render. To fix this, wrap the initialization of 'sankeyNodes' in its own useMemo() Hook.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./src/hooks/useClockLogic.ts
19:6  Warning: React Hook useMemo has an unnecessary dependency: 'tick'. Either exclude it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./src/hooks/useTimerLogic.ts
59:9  Warning: The 'onPointerMove' function makes the dependencies of useEffect Hook (at line 98) change on every render. To fix this, wrap the definition of 'onPointerMove' in its own useCallback() Hook.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
75:9  Warning: The 'onPointerUp' function makes the dependencies of useEffect Hook (at line 98) change on every render. To fix this, wrap the definition of 'onPointerUp' in its own useCallback() Hook.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
